# Examples

## Wallpaper pack workflow (A1111 + runner artifacts)

This example demonstrates an end-to-end local workflow using the `a1111_txt2img` adapter and ChoomLang runner state/artifacts.

### Prerequisites

- Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion Web UI is running with API enabled (`--api`).
- The API is reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:7860` (default adapter URL).

### Run

From the repository root:

```bash
choom run examples/wallpaper_pack.choom
```

Recommended (explicit run folder):

```bash
choom run examples/wallpaper_pack.choom --workdir runs/<runid>
```

### Expected outputs

The runner writes outputs under your run workdir, especially:

- `runs/<runid>/artifacts/` (or `./artifacts/` if no `--workdir` is provided)
- PNG files generated by A1111 adapter with deterministic names
- `manifest.txt` containing the returned image path list
- `index.html` with a simple local gallery/manifest view

The workflow captures image list output in `id=images` and reuses it via interpolation (`@images`) when writing `manifest.txt` and `index.html`.
